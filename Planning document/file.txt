plan to resolve bugs in steps

1.	Identifing the bugs:
	Identify two bugs:
	Multiple puzzle pieces can be dropped into one drop zone.
    Puzzle pieces remain in drop zones when resetting the game or changing the puzzle.
2.	Fixing the First Bug:
	Update the handleDrop function:
	neede to make sure if the drop-zone already contains a puzzle piece.
	If it does, prevent dropping the new piece.
	If no, allow dropping the new piece and replace any existing piece.
3.	Fixing the Second Bug:
	Create a new function, say reset
	Reparenting all puzzle pieces from drop zones back to the puzzle-pieces container (drag-zone).
4.	Implementation:
	Modifying the handleDrop function to incorporate the check for existing puzzle pieces.
	Create and call the resetPuzzlePieces function when resetting the game or changing the puzzle.
5.	Refinement:
	Debug and refine code if any issues arise during testing.
6.	Documentation:
	Document changes made for future reference.

This plan outlines the steps needed to address the bugs and improve the puzzle game's functionality.
